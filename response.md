        <question>
            Which of the following is a valid data type in C?
        </question>
        <answers>1. String</answers>
        <answers>2. Boolean</answers>
        <answers>3. int</answers>
        <answers>4. List</answers>
        <correctAnswer>3</correctAnswer>
        <explanation>The correct answer is 3. The basic data types in C include int, char, float, and others, but there is no built-in "String" or "List" data type in C.</explanation>

        <title>Functions in C</title>
        <question>
            What is the purpose of defining a function in C?
        </question>
        <answers>1. To declare variables</answers>
        <answers>2. To create a new data type</answers>
        <answers>3. To encapsulate a set of instructions</answers>
        <answers>4. To print output to the console</answers>
        <correctAnswer>3</correctAnswer>
        <explanation>The correct answer is 3. Functions in C allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions that can be called and reused throughout your program, making your code more modular and maintainable.</explanation>

        <title>Limitations of Computers</title>
        <question>
            Which of the following is an example of a limitation of computer hardware or software when dealing with data representation?
        </question>
        <answers>1. Inability to store negative numbers</answers>
        <answers>2. Lack of support for user input</answers>
        <answers>3. Inability to perform arithmetic operations</answers>
        <answers>4. Integer overflow</answers>
        <correctAnswer>4</correctAnswer>
        <explanation>The correct answer is 4. Integer overflow is a well-known limitation of computer systems when working with limited-size data types, where the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that can be represented by the data type.</explanation>

        <title>Comparing C to Scratch</title>
        <question>
            How does the C programming language differ from Scratch in terms of complexity and underlying concepts?
        </question>
        <bestAnswer>
            The C programming language is more complex than Scratch, but they share similar underlying concepts. While Scratch uses a visual, block-based programming approach, C is a text-based language that requires writing source code. C also provides more low-level control and access to computer hardware, whereas Scratch is more focused on high-level, event-driven programming. However, both languages rely on similar programming constructs, such as variables, conditional statements, and loops, despite the difference in complexity and syntax.
        </bestAnswer>
        <explanation>
            The question asks about the differences in complexity and underlying concepts between C and Scratch, which the summarized transcript addresses. The best answer highlights that C is more complex than Scratch, but they share similar underlying programming concepts, despite the difference in programming paradigm and syntax.

        <title>The Role of Compilers</title>
        <question>
            Explain the role of compilers in the context of the C programming language.
        </question>
        <bestAnswer>
            Compilers play a crucial role in the C programming language. They are responsible for translating the human-readable source code written by programmers into machine-readable instructions that the computer can execute. The compiler takes the C code, analyzes it, and generates the corresponding machine code, which can then be run by the computer's processor. This process of converting high-level programming language to low-level machine code is essential for C programs to be able to run on a computer system.
        </bestAnswer>
        <explanation>
            The question asks about the role of compilers in the context of the C programming language, which is directly addressed in the summarized transcript. The best answer explains the key function of compilers in translating human-readable C code into machine-readable instructions that can be executed by the computer's hardware.
